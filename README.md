# Digital Scholarship Foundations Static Website Series

## Workshop Overview

Digital Scholarship Foundations is a series of library workshops led by [Digital Scholarship Services (DiScho)](https://library.princeton.edu/services/digital-scholarship).

Our fall program is centered around digital mapping to develop fundamental skills necessary for a variety of digital projects. Participants will attend four workshops where they will learn about version control, data wrangling, coding templates, web publishing, and more as they transform research into spatial data and build their own interactive map.

## Digital Scholarship at PUL

DiScho offers [regular programming](https://library.princeton.edu/services/digital-scholarship/digital-scholarship-workshops-and-events) every semester that focus on data, digital publishing, and more. Our colleagues in the library also [offer workshops](https://libcal.princeton.edu/calendar?cid=-1&t=d&d=0000-00-00&cal=-1&inc=0) that may be of interest to digital scholarship practitioners.

The workshop series is influenced by [Learn-Static](https://learn-static.github.io/) and [Lib-Static](https://lib-static.github.io/). Some of the series materials were previously collaboratively developed for a [DH summer institute](https://princeton-cdh.github.io/athens2025/) at the Princeton Athens Center in 2025.
