Our fall 2025 series will be centered around digital mapping to develop fundamental skills necessary for a variety of digital projects. We will explore how maps are made and the tension between the uncertainty of our research and the precision of mapping tools. Participants will attend four workshops where they will learn about version control, data wrangling, coding templates, web publishing, and more as they transform research into spatial data and build their own interactive map.
