DSF Digital Mapping is a four-part workshop series led by Digital Scholarship Services (DiScho) that introduces you to digital mapping and the underlying skills that make creating your own digital project possible. Our series is influenced by the [Lib-Static approach](https://lib-static.github.io/about/).

## Learning Objectives

- Participants will apply version control methods. 
- Participants will recognize different types of data, the file types that support them, and how to use them.
- Participants will effectively manage project repositories.
- Participants will learn the building blocks of the web and digital publication.
- Participants will develop their own project or proof of concept.
- Participants will discuss the ethics and responsibilities of working with data and digital maps.

## Why Learn with Digital Maps

Digital maps require a range of digital tools and methods, which allow us here at DiScho to explore and share values important to our mission such as:

- Teaching transferable skills
- Project sustainability and preservation
- Thinking critically about the application and limitation of digital methods
- Lowering barriers to entry

By focusing on learning the underlying skills that ensure the success and sustainability of a digital map, we think that attendees will be better prepared to address their own research and project needs going forward.

## Why Use Digital Maps with your Research

Digital maps enable:

- Spatial analysis
- Representation or illustration of evidence or arguments
- Storytelling
